<h1> <b> Exercise 2 </b> </h1>

<p>
  For the second exercise of this class, I've created a stamp-based program with a mouseX and mouseY text indicator on the top as well as an animated grid background I created using the random() function and the += calls as well as using local and global variables to control the events of certain functions and objects. I've learned to experiment with image stamps as well as my first time creating and writing functions. I've also experimented with mouseIsPressed() and keyPressed() functions as well as learning to use if and switch statements. The biggest challenge of this exercise is that my keys weren't working, and my keyboard case controls have been double-triggering because I made my keyChoice() function to handle two functions that were holding separate images for a keyboard control toggle. I've also emptied out the key as (key = '') part of the global variables series, which stopped all my keyboard controls from working. So I fixed that by putting the main keyboard case control under keyChoice() and then created a separate key function toggle for images under imageChoice(), and now my keyboard controls are working as expected.
</p>

<p>
  Going into what I want to create, I've created a JavaScript program where the text on the top right corner tracks where your mouse is on the screen, as well as making random text appear in certain parts of the canvas. I've also made keyboard controls where shapes appear when you click on the screen, toggled by a keyboard control. In addition to that, I've also made keyboard controls to reset the grid animation, as well as changing the colors of the grid background. Lastly, I've made a stamp section where you hit a certain key to change the image of the stamp. These stamps resemble some of my favorite fast food places to eat at, and the stamps can be moved around the screen using W (up), A (left), S (down), and D (right).
